"used in both training and re-ranking at inference time. The ColBERT model is trained using a pairwise ranking loss, where the training data consists of triples (q,d+,d−)(q, d^+, d^-)(q,d+,d−), where qqq represents a query, d+d^+d+ is a relevant (positive) document for the query, and d−d^-d− is a",https://jina.ai/news/what-is-colbert-and-late-interaction-and-why-they-matter-in-search/,0.6085054278373718

"ColBERT encodes documents (and queries) into bags of embeddings, with each token in a document having its own embedding. This approach inherently means that for longer documents, more embeddings will be stored, which is a pain point of  the original ColBERT, and later addressed by ColBERTv2.
